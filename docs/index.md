Nap is a command-line interface (CLI) for running HTTP requests using YAML files with a clear, concise syntax. You can write routines, requests and even limited scripts using your favorite text editor. You can then check those files into source control and intregate Nap with your CI/CD pipeline.

Browse the docs to learn more about how Nap can save you and your customers time and frustration with better, faster test automation.
